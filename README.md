  Simple enemy akin to Goombas from Mario that change direction on contact with wall
  

* <img src="/screenshots/day5-follower.gif" width="320" height="240" />

  Follower that chases when player gets too close. Also demostrates freezing of enemies when traveling to an alternate world
  

Plant on lock down on mechanics tomorrow or the day after in order to start making progress on graphics and level design
